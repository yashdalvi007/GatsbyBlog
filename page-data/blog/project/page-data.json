Finding a source for Gatsby was by far the most difficult thing to do. But thankfully Andrew mead provides an amazing bootcamp free of cost on Youtube where rather than starting from a well designed template it starts with a simple hello world starter and develops on it.","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"embedded-asset-block","content":[],"data":{"target":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"tj7g5ur0tn32","contentful_id":"tj7g5ur0tn32"}},"id":"c3PmdzHW4GgBv5JoiMIBPQf","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2020-07-16T01:10:42.989Z","updatedAt":"2020-07-16T01:10:42.989Z","environment":{"sys":{"id":"master","type":"Link","linkType":"Environment","contentful_id":"master"}},"revision":1,"contentful_id":"3PmdzHW4GgBv5JoiMIBPQf"},"fields":{"title":{"en-US":"chris"},"file":{"en-US":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/tj7g5ur0tn32/3PmdzHW4GgBv5JoiMIBPQf/f97ed0e4ecb46c09115dc50834d87742/chris.gif","details":{"size":2530692,"image":{"width":498,"height":398}},"fileName":"chris.gif","contentType":"image/gif"}}}}}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"","marks":[],"data":{}}],"data":{}},{"nodeType":"paragraph","content":[{"nodeType":"text","value":"Gatsby has so far raised an interest in me by making it possible to easily use CMS's using some basic plugins so I can also create dynamic websites.
